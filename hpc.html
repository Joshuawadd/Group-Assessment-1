      High Performance Computing is the use of parallel computing resources to solve difficult problems in a reasonable amount of time.
        High Performance Computing can come in many different forms, from supercomputers to GPGPUs these all fall under the heading of "High Performance Computing devices".
        Although the distribution of these systems and devices is very interesting, the problems they can help us solve are countless and can help shape our everyday lives.

              <h5><u>Numerical Weather Prediction</u></h5>
              Using mathematical models we can simulate the behaviour of our atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather. The chaotic nature of the atmosphere is modeled by partial differential equations. These equations have no exact solutions hence need to be solved numerically. Solving these equations numerically is not an easy thing to do and is a task undertaken by some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world.

                <h5><u>Computational Chemistry</u></h5>
                Predicting and synthesising new chemicals is a time-consuming and costly process often involving a lot of trial and error. However chemical interactions can be predicted from large information sets of known interactions and detailed simulations. These simulations can be very detailed and very complex and benefit from GPGPU. After using computation to find theoretically viable options, chemists can test these options, saving time and money and allowing chemicals to be discovered that couldn't be discovered before.

                Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are revolutionising our world. More details can be found <a href="machinelearning.html">here</a>. However, these models require lots of training, which boils down to crunching a lot of numbers. This training can be dramatically speed up using GPUs.
